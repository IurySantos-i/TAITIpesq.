Hello <%= @user.email %>!

Someone tried to sign up for a new Action Center account with this e-mail address, but an account already exists. If you forgot your password, you can change it with the link below.

<%= new_password_url(@user, :reset_password_token => @token) %>

Your password won't change until you access the link above and create a new one.
This link will expire in 6 hours.
